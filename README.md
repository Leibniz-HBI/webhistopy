# WebHistoPy

Experimental reconceptualisation of Webhistorian as an application written in Python. Right now just a feasibility check, so consider it pre-alpha.

It can be adapted and build with the [Beeware framework](https://beeware.org/). Take their tutorial, which needs basic Python skills, and you should be able to work on and with this project.

At the moment, the app has no localisation and labels and dialogues are in German as it is meant to be UX-tested with German participants.
